## About
**New** I'll be pursuing my CS PhD at UBC starting this fall! My area of interest is programming languages. In particular, I'm interested in how we can exploit programming languages (such as their type systems) to facilitate verification or synthesis tasks.

I'm currently a Software Engineer in [Coderrect Inc.](https://coderrect.com/) where I'm the main developer of an LLVM-based static analyzer for concurrent programs. My previous research mainly focuses on static analysis, especially detecting concurrency bugs, but I'm generally interested in all PL related techniques.


I got my MS in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, adviced by [Dr. Jeff Huang](http://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. from Department of Electrical Engineering, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).

## Misc
I was often asked how to pronounce my first name correctly. It contains 2 Chinese characters ("Yan" and "Ze"). Therefore, it should be pronounced as "YEHN-ZUH". Nevertheless, I'm happy with any pronunciation.

I'm a huge fan of video games (although I don't have enough time playing them since I started doing research).
I love games with good story-telling (e.g., Life is Strange/Detroit: Become Human) and games with sci-fi/cyberpunk backgrounds. I sincerely hope video games can be a main stream for story-telling someday.
