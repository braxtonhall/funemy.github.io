## About

I'm currently a Software Engineer in [Coderrect Inc.](https://coderrect.com/) where I'm the main developer of an LLVM-based race detection framework. My previous research mainly focus on static analysis, especially detecting concurrency bugs, but I'm generally interested in all PL related techniques.


I got my MS in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, adviced by [Dr. Jeff Huang](http://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. from Department of Electrical Engineering, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).


I'm currently looking for **PhD openings in 2021Fall**, my areas of interest are type system/verification/static analysis.

## Misc

I'm a huge fan of video games (although I don't have enough time playing them since I started doing research).
I love games with good story-telling (e.g., Life is Strange/Detroit: Become Human) and games with sci-fi/cyberpunk backgrounds.
I sincerely hope video games can be a main stream for story-telling someday.
