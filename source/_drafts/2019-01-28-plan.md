Just want to set a flag for myself and make full use of the year.

<!-- more -->

1. Finish reading *<Static Program Analysis>*. I still feel I'm lack of a systematic view of static analysis.

2. Learn **idris**. Abandoned Haskell for no good reason, I should pick those things up soon.

3. Finish `Crappie`(crappy lmao). You will know what it is when I finish it.
