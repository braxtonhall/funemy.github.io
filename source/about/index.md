## About
I'm a second-year Master student at Department of Computer Science, Texas A&M University. 
I'm currently a member of [Dr. Jeff Huang](http://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/)'s ASER lab. I'm generally interested in Programming Language related techniques, and applying them to make Software Engineering better. Before that, I got my B.E. degree from Department of Electrical Engineering, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).

## Misc
I'm a huge fan of video games (although I don't have enough time playing them since I started doing research).
I love games with good story-telling (e.g., Life is Strange/Detroit: Become Human) and games with sci-fi/cyberpunk backgrounds.
I sincerely hope video games can be a main stream for story-telling someday.
